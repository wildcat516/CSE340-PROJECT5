# CSE340-PROJECT5
Project 5

Due: 12/4/16 on or before 11:59:59pm MST

The goal of this project is to give you some hands-on experience with implementing a small compiler. You will write a compiler for a simple language. You will not be generating low level code. Instead, you will generate an intermediate representation (a data structure that represents the program). The execution of the program will be done after compilation by interpreting the generated intermediate representation.
